      <h2>Hi, My Baby</h2>
      <p>I still can’t quite believe it’s already been a month since then. In such a short time, you’ve brought so much joy, so much meaning into my life, reminding me that even when we’re miles apart, love can feel incredibly close, incredibly real. I may not have heard the sound of your voice or felt the warmth of your touch yet, but somehow, even from this distance, you’ve given me something rare—something beautiful—a sense of home.

You’ve taught me that love doesn’t depend on proximity; it thrives, even from afar. And for that, I’m endlessly grateful. You manage to bring a smile to my face when it feels like I can’t smile at all. That’s a gift I don’t take for granted. Thank you for coming into my life, for making it more than I ever imagined it could be. You’ve carved a space in my heart no one could ever fill.

<br><br><br>So show me how to love you the way you need to be loved. Reveal all the layers of who you are. I want you—every part of you. I’ll love you unconditionally, from the scars you carry to the deepest corners of your soul.

Here’s to us—the moments we’ve shared, and the countless more that await us when we’re finally together. Thank you for being the light in my days and for giving me a future to look forward to.

<br><br><br>I love you, Elena. I love you more than words can ever say, and I will love you, always—for the rest of time.</p>
