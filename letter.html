      <h2>Hi, My Baby</h2>
      <p>>I can’t believe it’s already been a month since then. In just this short time, you’ve brought so much joy and meaning into my life, proving that even from miles away, love can feel so close and so real. I may not have yet heard the sound of your voice or felt the comfort of your touch, but even from afar, you’ve given me something rare and beautiful—a sense of home. You’ve shown me that love can thrive no matter the distance, and for that, I’m endlessly grateful.

        Here’s to us—to the moments we’ve already shared and to the countless memories I know we’ll create when we’re finally together. Thank you for being the best part of my days and for giving me so much to look forward to.
        
        I love you, Elena. I love you more than words can ever say, and I will continue loving you—for the rest of eternity.</p>
